\ProvidesPackage{mkessler-faktor}[2022/01/30 - Faktor package that also handles cofaktors]



% Extension the faktor package for 
% - cofaktor command that provides A \ B notation
% - scaling the / in the middle
% - fine positioning of enumerator / denominator

% This is essentially taken from the stackexchange question found at
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27591/extending-the-faktor-package
% and answered by 'Werner' (https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/5764/werner)
%
% This package only packages the corresponding answer and provides an analoguous way of a \cofactor command

%Dependencies
\RequirePackage{xparse}
\RequirePackage{amssymb} % provides \diagup and \diagdown
\RequirePackage{ifthen} % ifthenelse syntax
\RequirePackage{mathtools}
